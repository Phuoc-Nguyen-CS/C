Binary Representation
    -- Example --
       - 1011 in binary
       - (1 * 2^3) + (0 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0) = 11
    Signed integers use Most Significant Bit (MSB) to denote
        - 0 for positive
        - 1 for negative

Bitwise Operators
    - AND (&): Returns 1 if both are 1
        - Useful for filtering
    - OR (|): Returns 1 if at least one of the the bits is 1
        - Useful for setting
    - XOR (^): Returns 1 if bits are different
        - Find unique elements
    - NOT (~): Inverts the bits
    - Shift Left (<<): Multipling by power of 2
    - Shift Right (>>): Dividing by powers of two

Tips for Manipulation
    Clearing the lowest set bit:
        x & (x - 1)
    Checking power of two:
        x & (x - 1) == 0
    Finding the position of the lowest set bit:
        x & -x

Common Patterns in Bit Manipulation Problems
    Counting Bits: May require counting # of 1's in binary number
        - Use x & (x - 1) to count number of 1'set
    XOR Trick: 
        x ^ x = 0
        x ^ 0 = x

Two's Complement
    1.) Flip all bits
    2.) Add 1 to it
