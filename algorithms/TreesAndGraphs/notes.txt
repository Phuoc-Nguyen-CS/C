// Trees Notes

Trees: a data structure composed of nodes
- Has a root nodes
    - Has 0 or more child nodes
        - Child node has 0 or more child nodes etc..

- Can't contain cycles
- Can be in any order
- May/May Not have links back to their parent nodes

    -- Example --
class Node {
    public String name;
    public Node[] children;
}

Class Tree {
    public Node root;
}

Trees vs. Binary Trees

Binary Tree:
- Has up to two children
    - Anymore and it is not longer considered binary Tree
- Node is called "leaf" if no children

Binary Tree vs. Binary Search Tree
- A binary tree that follows:
    all left descendents <= n < all right descendents
